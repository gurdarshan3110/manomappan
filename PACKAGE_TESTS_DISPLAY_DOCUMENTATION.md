# Package Tests Display on Home Page

## Overview
The home page now displays included tests for each package in the "Our Plans" section. This shows users what tests they will receive with each package purchase.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

#### PageController Update
- Modified `home()` method to load packages with their associated tests
- Added eager loading with constraints to only show activated tests
- Tests are ordered by display name for consistent presentation

```php
$packages = Package::isActive()->with(['tests' => function ($query) {
    $query->where('activated', true)->orderBy('display_name');
}])->get();
```

### Frontend Changes

#### Desktop View (Table Format)
- Added new row "Included Tests" in the plans comparison table
- Shows bulleted list of test names for packages with tests
- Displays "No Tests" for packages without tests
- Uses green checkmarks (✓) as bullet points

#### Mobile View (Card Format)
- Added "Included Tests" section in each package card
- Shows tests in a compact list format
- Maintains responsive design principles

### CSS Styling

#### Test List Styles
- `.test-list` - Desktop table version
- `.test-list-mobile` - Mobile card version
- Green checkmarks as bullet points
- Subtle borders between test items
- Responsive font sizing
