                                                : Over the years, CA starting salaries have seen an uptick. A decade
                                                ago, a fresh CA might earn â‚¹6-7 LPA in industry jobs. Now, average
                                                packages
                                                are closer to â‚¹9-10 LPA. In ICAI's recent campus placement (2024), the
                                                average CTC offered was about â‚¹12.5 LPA to new CAs and the highest
                                                domestic salary reached ~â‚¹26-29 LPA. (A slight drop from previous high
                                                due to market conditions, as the prior year saw â‚¹29 LPA highest.) Top
                                                consulting companies and investment banks sometimes offer even higher
                                                packages for exceptional candidates or those with niche skills (e.g.,

                                                ICAI is one of the largest professional bodies. CAs benefit from a vast

                                                knowledge portals. This network often helps in career advancement
                                                and business opportunities.

                                                After becoming a CA, one can start an independent practice. Being

                                                is relatively low (ICAI fees), so return on investment is high
